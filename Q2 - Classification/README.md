# Predict Fraudulent Transactions

## Problem Statement
Societe Generale (SocGen) is a French multinational banking and financial services company. With over 1,54,000 employees, based in 76 countries, they handle over 32 million clients throughout the world on a daily basis.

They provide services like retail banking, corporate and investment banking, asset management, portfolio management, insurance and other financial services.

While dealing with innumerable money transactions, theyâ€™ve set up an internal team which closely monitors and alarms the transactions which could be deemed fraudulent.

In this problem, given an anonymised data of transactions, you have to predict the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.
